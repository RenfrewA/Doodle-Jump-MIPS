# Doodle-Jump-MIPS
In this project for CSC258 (Computer Organization), we implemented the popular mobile game Doodle Jump using MIPS assembly.

Since we don't have access to a physical computer with a MIPS processor, we will use a simulated environment within MARS, i.e., a simulated bitmap display and a simulated keyboard input.
